# Multi-Engine Game Conversion Framework by Tovakai

A deliberately un-snappy desktop and command-line application for converting
supported indie-game runtimes to native Linux ARM64 packages, initially targeting
the Steam Frame.

There is no short public product name. You have to say the whole thing.

## Current engine backends

| Engine family | Backend | Conversion strategy | Hardware status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ren'Py | RenFrame | replace the distributed runtime with a matching Linux ARM64 Ren'Py runtime | proven separately in RenFrame; combined path needs validation |
| RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace | RPGMFrame / mkxp-z | replace RGSS player with Linux ARM64 mkxp-z plus compatibility migration | XP boots on Steam Frame |
| RPG Maker MV / MZ | RPGMFrame / NW.js | replace Windows NW.js with Linux ARM64 NW.js plus generic compatibility repairs | MV and MZ validated on Steam Frame |
| Godot | RPGMFrame / Godot | preserve PCK and launch it with the exact matching official Linux ARM64 Godot runtime | Godot 4.3 title running on Steam Frame |

The combined application routes by detected engine. The backend packages remain
visible in the repository so engine-specific fixes can stay focused instead of
turning the umbrella router into a giant conditional swamp.

## Install for development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
pytest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv-win
.\.venv-win\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

## Use the extremely reasonable executable name

Inspect a game:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai inspect /path/to/game
```

Build it:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai build /path/to/game
```

Successful builds now also produce a `*-linux-aarch64.zip` by default. The ZIP
keeps Linux execute bits in its archive metadata so it can be dropped directly
into FrameDrop or Frame Control as a native ARM64 title.

On Linux ARM64, add the converted build straight to the local Steam library:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai steam-install /path/to/Game-frame
```

Or do both in one pass:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai build /path/to/game --add-to-steam
```

The GUI exposes the same flow as an **Add to Steam** button after conversion
when running on Linux ARM64.

Open the GUI:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai gui
```

There is also a second executable named
`multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai-gui`, because apparently
one long command was not enough.

## Ren'Py runtime resolution

Ren'Py now follows the same automatic-runtime philosophy as the other backends.
When inspection yields an exact Ren'Py 7.x or 8.x release, the RenFrame backend:

1. normalizes the detected release to `X.Y.Z`
2. downloads the official `renpy-X.Y.Z-sdkarm.tar.bz2` from renpy.org
3. verifies its SHA-256 against the official `checksums.txt`
4. extracts only the matching `py2-linux-aarch64` or
   `py3-linux-aarch64` platform slice
5. validates an AArch64 ELF runtime
6. caches that platform slice for later conversions
7. grafts it into a copy of the original distributed game

The original game's `renpy/` engine tree and other payload files are preserved.
This is intentionally more surgical than replacing the game with a complete SDK.

The converter does **not** substitute a nearby Ren'Py version when detection is
ambiguous. A manual runtime remains available as an escape hatch:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai build Game.zip \
  --renpy-runtime /path/to/reviewed-renpy-arm64-runtime
```

Set `MEGCFBT_CACHE_DIR` to relocate the shared runtime cache. RenFrame also
honors `RENFRAME_CACHE_DIR` for its own runtime cache.

## Steam artwork

Pass a portrait/grid cover during conversion with:

```bash
multi-engine-game-conversion-framework-by-tovakai build /path/to/game \
  --steam-cover /path/to/cover.png
```

The artwork is stored inside the converted build under
`.megcfbt/artwork/`. The on-device Steam installer applies bundled grid art
through the running Steam client's library API and also uses a bundled
`icon.png` or `logo.png` as a shortcut icon when one exists. The metadata
layout has slots for `grid`, `wide`, `hero`, `logo`, and `icon` so
automatic source-art/SteamGridDB filling can be added without changing engine
backends.

Converted builds also contain `.megcfbt/package.json`, which records the
canonical launcher and the `SteamLinuxRuntime_4-arm64` runtime. This keeps
Steam/Frame integration outside RenFrame, RPGMFrame, and the Godot backend.

## Design rule

A game exposing a compatibility problem is a test case, not a product target.
Prefer engine-level and platform-level fixes over title-specific patches. Keep
source payloads intact unless a generic compatibility repair is justified.
